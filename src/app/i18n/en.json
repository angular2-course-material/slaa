  "PROGRAM": {
    "TALKS_KEYNOTES": "Talks and Keynotes",
    "KEYNOTE_1_TITLE": "Word-sized Visualizations for Analysing Eye-Tracking Data",
    "KEYNOTE_1_DESCRIPTION": "Eye-tracking studies the visual movements that we perform while looking at a visual stimulus. In order to transmit the results of eye-tracking studies, we need to order and summarize them. Tables and graphs are very useful, but are limited by space and require to look back and forth from the paragraphs. Word-sized visualizations are small versions of established visualizations, that make easier the integration with text and reduce the impact of space limitation. In this talk, we will explore the word sized visualizations to analyze data from an eye-tracking study.",
    "KEYNOTE_2_TITLE": "Program Analysis",
    "KEYNOTE_2_DESCRIPTION": "Formal analysis of programs aims to discover or infer facts about the programs, allowing us to optimize, transform and verify them. The goal is to build tools that help developers understand their programs and detect bugs. There are three families of analysis techniques: 1) static, where  we analyse programs without running them, in compile time 2) dynamic, where we analyse execution traces while the program is executed, and 3) hybrid, that combines static and dynamic aspects. For scalability reasons, static analysis is conservative: an abstract state represents two or more concrete states. On the other hand, dynamic analysis is more precise, since the concrete state of the program is known. In this talk, I will give a general vision of of formal program analysis and will present some current challenges.",
    "KEYNOTE_3_TITLE": "Exploración Visual de Eventos Noticiosos Extraídos de Social Media en su Contexto Spacio-Temporal",
    "KEYNOTE_3_DESCRIPTION": "Las plataformas de social media se han convertido en enormes repositorios de información acerca de lo que pasa en el mundo y como la gente reacciona a esos eventos. Sin embargo, extraer información de estas plataformas no es una tarea fácil ya que todos los días se publican millones de mensajes. Por otra parte, estos documentos son muy volátiles por lo que es difícil recuperarlos después de pasado un tiempo. Por lo tanto, para poder sacar información útil de estos datos es necesario desarrollar formas eficientes y eficaces de guardarlos y explorarlos. En esta charla presentaremos Galean, una herramienta de visualización de eventos noticiosos extraídos desde Twitter en su contexto geo-temporal, además del modelo subyacente que los representa. En particular, nuestro enfoque es considerar las ubicaciones de un evento como entidades que se relacionan entre sí y que dan forma a la evolución de un evento en el tiempo.",
    "KEYNOTE_4_TITLE": "Do Developers Use Your Tool As You Expected?",
    "KEYNOTE_4_DESCRIPTION": "Analyzing how software engineers use development tools is fundamental to better understanding how engineers carry out their daily tasks. Especially tool designers need to know if their tools are used the way they envisioned it.<br/>This talk presents an evaluation of how software engineers use SPOTTER—a search engine—in practice. To archives this, we remotely gathered user actions and developed a visual alphabet, that aids the analysis.<br/>We found common usage patterns and identified underused SPOTTER features. Such findings are essential for improving SPOTTER.",
    "KEYNOTE_5_TITLE": "SPY2: Dynamic Analysis at the reach of everyone",
    "KEYNOTE_5_DESCRIPTION": "Exposing the runtime behavior of an application is a really important practice to understand software and evaluate its quality. Unfortunately, creating these tools usually involves modifying the virtual machine and/or the internals of the system. We present a novel approach that allow programmers to create their own customized profiler that address their own needs minimizing their exposure to the internals of the system.",
    "KEYNOTE_6_TITLE": "Performance Regression Prediction",
    "KEYNOTE_6_DESCRIPTION": "Los cambios en el código fuente pueden introducir regresiones en performance.  Estas regresiones se refieren a situaciones donde el rendimiento de un programa se degrada en comparación a versiones anteriores del mismo, aunque la nueva version funcione correctamente. Por ejemplo, cuando un version nuevo es mas lenta que la anterior, pero sigue funcionando correctamente.<br/>Ejecutar puntos de referencia en cada version es una técnica tradicional utilizada para identificar regresiones en etapas tempranas. Sin embargo, a pesar de ser efectiva, esta técnica exhaustiva es difícil de llevar a cabo en la práctica, principalmente por la alta sobrecarga que esta actividad demanda. En esta charla se hablara las diferentes técnicas que existen para predecir si una nueva versión puede introducir una regression o no (sin ejecutar costosos puntos de referencia). El objetivo de estas técnicas es reducir la sobrecarga que se requiere para monitorear el rendimiento de cada versión, ejecutando los puntos de referencia solo en las versiones que contengan cambios costosos de código fuente.",
    "KEYNOTE_7_TITLE": "VisualID: Usando iconos auto-generados para resolver problemas en ingeniería de software",
    "KEYNOTE_7_DESCRIPTION": "Glyphs son iconos auto-generados comúnmente usados en la identificación de objetos. A pesar de ser populares en la comunidad de interacción humano computador, los glyphs son raramente usados para resolver problemas en ingeniería de software. En esta charla presentaremos la técnica VisualID-glyph para resolver dos problemas comunes durante el mantenimiento del software: 1) identificar classes que tienen las mismas dependencias y clases con métodos similares.",
    "TUTORIAL_1_TITLE": "Statistics Programming",
    "TUTORIAL_1_DESCRIPTION": "Nowadays, it is necessary to use tools to process and analyse data. R es one of these tools, that has quickly become in the language of statistics, allowing us to write programs that read, handle and analyse data. In this tutorial, we will cover the basic concepts of R. We will start with variables and basic operations, and then continue with data structures like vectors, matrices, data frames and lists. We will also explore the graphic capacities of R.",
    "TUTORIAL_2_TITLE": "Data Mining con Python y Jupyter",
    "TUTORIAL_2_DESCRIPTION": "La idea del tutorial es aprender lo básico de Python para hacer tareas de procesamiento y minería de datos. Para esto usaremos Jupyter (<a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\">http://jupyter.org/</a>) y exploraremos las ventajas de usar esta herramienta para compartir código y crear widgets interactivos para analizar datos. Al final del tutorial, trabajaremos en un proyecto en donde se utilizarán las herramientas aprendidas.",
